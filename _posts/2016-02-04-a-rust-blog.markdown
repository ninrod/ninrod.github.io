Hi I'm Ninrod. I'll be mainly talking about [Rust][1] as I carve my way through the learning process.

Let us test how Jekyll renders rust code with a simple hello world:

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() { 
  println!("Hello");
}
/* prints hello world to STDOUT */
{% endhighlight %}

And that's it for today!
